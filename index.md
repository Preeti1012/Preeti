I am a PhD student at IIT Bombay's [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/), working under the guidance of [Prof. Mythili Vutukuru](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/), exploring the area of Systems and Networking.

I completed my M.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from IIITDM, Jabalpur. Before that, I completed my MCA from the Department ofÂ Computer Science and B.Sc. from Women's College of [Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh] (https://www.amu.ac.in/). I also interned at Wipro Ltd. in Greater Noida after MCA.

Currently, I am exploring the Programmability of Linux Network Stack, which plays a pivotal role in granting developers the ability to modify, extend, and optimize networking behaviors within the Linux operating system. In my PhD seminar [abstract], I reviewed several research works showcasing the possibility of programmability at different levels of Linux Operating System.
